# pi-wifi
This is a Raspberry PI project that scans nearby wifi access points, and regularly picks the strongest signal. I created this to solve the very specific purpose of getting more stable wifi in the campground where we vacation every summer.

## Setup
1. install RaspberryPI OS on your raspberry pi
2. Run the setup.sh script from this repository
3. Once connected to `pi-wifi`, navigate to `http://192.168.10.1` and configure the RaspberryPI through the pi-wifi admin console.
